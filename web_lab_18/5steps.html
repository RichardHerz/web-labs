  <p style="color:Red;"><em><strong>5 STEPS to building the blockchain:</strong></em></p>
  <p> On opening the simulation, only the &quot;<em>Genesis Block</em>&quot; is
    present in the blockchain field on the far right or far bottom of the page, depending on your screen
    size and orientation.
    The Genesis Block is block number 0, in which Catoshi created tokens and
    distributed them to 5 friends.

  <li>
  <p>
    <em><strong>Create a transaction:</strong></em> Select To, From and enter an amount.
    Transactions show the addresses, not the names of the people to whom the address belongs.
    This makes transactions anonymous.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
    <em><strong>Verify the transaction:</strong></em> This step checks to make sure two different
    addresses have been entered and a nonzero amount that is less than or equal to the current
    balance of the From address has been entered. After verification, the transaction is added
    to a pool of pending transactions on the peer network.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
    <em><strong>Build block:</strong></em> This step checks to make sure you have entered at least
    two verified transactions, then creates a provisional block. Real blockchains have blocks
    with thousands of transactions in order to reduce the cost per transaction. Miners on the peer
    network collect pending transactions and form provisional blocks.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
    <em><strong>Mine block:</strong></em> This step performs computations in order to achieve consensus
    on which provisional block created by miners should be added to the blockchain next.
    Since a real peer network will have many miners, each of whom can build a provisional block,
    they must reach consensus on which block to add next. The block of the first successful miner
    is added to the blockchain and they receive a reward of new tokens created by the blockchain algorithm.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
    <em><strong>Add block to chain:</strong></em> This step adds the new block to the top of the
    blockchain and also updates the balances of all users in the blockchain header.
