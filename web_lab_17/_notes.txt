QUESTION: does a bit change in long message cause fewer bit changes in hash that does a bit change in short message? 
ANSWER: should not because even a single change continues to propagate 

Check on what cryptocoin addresses are - hash of public key? 

Any way to combine RSA functions with this lab to make a simulation of a blockchain... 

especially where user could get to/from addresses and enter transactions and have code "mine" and return hash for new block?
