gist - add reactor and plot in RL WordPress home page with correct layout on desktop and mobileÂ 

THIS WORKS TO PUT REACTOR AND PLOT SIDE-BY-SIDE ON DESKTOP, AND OVER-UNDER ON IPHONE - NOT PERFECT BECAUSE when narrow window on desktop get scrollbar for iframe and not over-under...

Our objective is to encourage active learning with interactive simulations. Below is a quick example. Click the React button, then Empty, Fill and React again. Before reacting, you can change the temperature (hit enter/return key or click out of field after changing). <a href="http://reactorlab.net/web-labs/"><i>More Web Labs here</i></a>. &nbsp;<noscript><a href="https://enable-javascript.com/"><img src="http://reactorlab.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/js-click-info.png" alt="Javascript must be enabled" width="253" height="18" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1506"/></a></noscript>

The image is a schematic cross section of a cylindrical reactor and outer, annular heat transfer jacket. This type of reactor is called a batch reactor, since it makes product in batches vs. continuously. The reactant is blue. The product is red. The reaction rate is directly proportional to the reactant concentration: the rate is fast initially and then slows down as reactant is converted to product. The composition at equilibrium is almost all product. The temperature is uniform spatially due to good mixing, and is held constant by a control system and heat transfer to fluid circulating in the heat transfer jacket.

SEE IN IFRAME HTML <iframe id="idIframe" onload="iframeLoaded()"  ... 

function iframeLoaded() {
	var iFrameID = document.getElementById('idIframe');
