    <b><i>PFR - Plug Flow Reactor</i></b> - isothermal, n-th order reaction
  </p>

  <p>
    <b><i>Reaction.</i></b> The reaction is A &rarr; products. The reaction is n-th order in reactant. Density is constant. For simplicity, the reaction equilibrium composition is
    specified to be almost all product under all conditions, i.e., an essentially irreversible reaction.
    The concentration of reactant A is represented as cA.
