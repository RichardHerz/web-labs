Lab 000 – Artificial Zoo using SVG graphics

Grow fractal zoo creatures from genes: Brackens, dragons, etc.

This "artificial zoo" program is an L-system. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system

I was inspired to code this by Richard Dawkins’ book The Blind Watchmaker. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blind_Watchmaker 

ALSO SEE the dev folder for True BASIC and LiveCode versions.
