  <h3>Cryptocoin Blockchain - Teddy Token</h3>
  <p>
    This is an interactive simulation of the Teddy Token cryptocoin
    blockchain. This chain was started by Catoshi Purramoto in honor of his
    fellow feline Teddy.
  </p>
  <p><em><strong>GO TO THE SIMULATION</strong></em> &gt;&gt;
    <a href="index-sim.html">Teddy Token</a>
  </p>

  <p>On opening the simulation, only the &quot;<em><strong>Genesis Block</strong></em>&quot; is
    present in the blockchain field on the far right or far bottom of the page, depending on your screen
    size and orientation.
    The Genesis Block is block number 0, in which Catoshi Purramoto created tokens out of thin air and
    distributed them equally to 5 users. In Bitcoin's genesis block, Satoshi Nakamoto created out of
    thin air 50 bitcoins, which he sent to Hal Finey.
  </p>
  <h4>There are 5 steps for adding transactions to the blockchain:</h4>
  <ol>
  <li>
  <p>
    <em><strong>Create a transaction:</strong></em> Select To, From and enter an amount.
    Transactions show the addresses, not the names of the people to whom the address belongs.
    This makes transactions anonymous.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
    <em><strong>Verify the transaction:</strong></em> This step checks to make sure two different
    addresses have been entered and a nonzero amount that is less than or equal to the current
    balance of the From address has been entered. After verification, the transaction is added
    to a pool of pending transactions on the peer network.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
    <em><strong>Build block:</strong></em> This step checks to make sure you have entered at least
    two verified transactions, then creates a provisional block. Here you are required to enter
    at least two transactions in order to proceed to making a block. Real blockchains have blocks
    with thousands of transactions in order to reduce the cost per transaction. Miners on the peer
    network collect pending transactions and form provisional blocks.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
    <em><strong>Mine block:</strong></em> This step performs computations in order to verify the block.
    There are many methods for blocks to be verified. The method used by Bitcoin and Teddy Token
    is &quot;proof of work.&quot; This requires the miner to find a number which they add to the block
    header such that the hash of the block header starts with the target number of zeros.
    This number is called the nonce: a number used once. The target here is a small value so that
    the mining is fast. Real blockchains require a target value of many zeros such that mining
    requires significant time and computer power.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
    <em><strong>Add block to chain:</strong></em> This step adds the new block to the top of the
    blockchain and also updates the balances of all users in the blockchain header.
  </p>
  </li>
  </ol>
  <p><em><strong>ABOUT</strong></em></p>
  <p>
    Teddy Token's purpose is to show, in a simplified way, how blockchains and cryptocoins work.
    There are many differences between Teddy tokens and real cryptocoins. But the essentials are shown.
    See below for a partial list of differences.
  </p>
  <p>
    Blockchains are a sequential record of transactions, which may be simple transfers of cryptocoins,
    as in the case of Bitcoin and Teddy, or contracts in the form of computer algorithms, as in the
    case of Ethereum.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each block of transactions, as well as each individual transaction in a block, are identified by a
    hash value that prevents the transactions and the blockchain from being tampered with.
    The hashes also allow individual transactions and blocks to be located in the blockchain.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em><strong>Hashes are key to blockchains</strong></em>.
    They are values created by cryptographic hash algorithms operating on information such as public keys.
    They ensure that any future change in information, such as how many coins you have sent me,
    becomes obvious by a large change in the hash of the information, thus preventing tampering
    with the blockchain. Each block contains the hash of the previous block such that tampering with any
    block changes the hashes of all successive blocks, thus allowing identification and location of the problem.
  </p>
  <p>See Web Lab 17 for a demonstration of hashing. Lab 16 has a demonstration of public-key encryption.</p>
  <p>Cryptocoins have several additional advantages in addition to that of security.
    They can be exchanged anonymously through the hash addresses, which cannot be reverse engineered to
    discover the owner. They can be exchanged by any user at small cost compared to bank transfers.
    Their value is that perceived by all users and not directly dependent on government policies.</p>
  <p>
    <em><strong>Cryptocoins are created out of thin air</strong></em> initially.
    Satoshi Nakamoto created the initial 50 bitcoins out of thin air. Catoshi Purramoto created the initial
    50 Teddy tokens out of thin air. The number of bitcoins and Teddy tokens increases only as a result of
    the computational work done in mining, which is described in step 4 above. Although the initial coins
    were &quot;free,&quot; further coins require the expenditure of energy, which, in the case of Bitcoin,
    has become a noticable percentage of the world's energy budget.
  </p>
  <p>
    For what do people trade cryptocoins? Things of value, which they give in order to receive cryptocoins
    in payment. The first purchase with bitcoins is said to be that of a pizza. People also will sell
    their coins in exchange for government currency, e.g., U.S. dollars. Government currency is
    termed &quot;Fiat&quot; currency in the cryptocoin world. Fiat currency is not backed by a real asset
    such as gold, and depends on user confidence for value. Hmmm, that description also applies to cryptocurrency...
  </p>
  <p>
    There is no fixed price for cryptocoins. The coins are auctioned such that <em><strong>their value in
    government currency fluctuates with the perceived value of the coins</strong></em>. The real cost of
    electricity to mine sets a base price.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the Teddy Token simulation, the <em><strong>wallets field</strong></em> shows a partial snapshot of
    the wallet of each of the users. Shown are the names of the users, their addresses, and their Teddy
    token balance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Real individual users can only view their own wallet, which also contains their private and public
    encryption keys. Their address is the hash value of their public key.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a real blockchain, the computers of users and miners are distributed throughout the world in a
    peer-to-peer (P2P) network over the Internet.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Bitcoin and Teddy Token, the total number of coins can increase with time only due to the
    block reward coins given to the successful miner of a block. Mining has a real cost of
    the energy expended in computation, which, in Bitcoin's case, is substantial.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bitcoin started with only 50 coins and will max out at 21 million coins as the block
    reward decreases with time to zero. For the first several months after the start of
    Bitcoin, the first blocks mined contained only mining rewards. This built up the supply
    of bitcoins such that a suffient number existed for people to start trading bitcoins.
    The block reward stays constant in Teddy so there is no limit, other than your
    patience, to the number of tokens.
  </p>
  <h4>Some differences between Teddy Token and real blockchains</h4>
  <ol>
  <li>
  <p>
    Teddy Token is self-contained in your web browser. Real users and miners are distributed
    around the world and connected in P2P networks over the Internet.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
    You can see everyone's real names and balances in Teddy Token. Real users cannot see
    information about other users other than anonymous hash addresses and balances.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
    Teddy Token blocks require a minimum of only two transactions, in addition to the miner reward.
    Real blocks may involve thousands of transactions.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
    Teddy Token uses the &quot;proof-of-work&quot; concensus method for verifying and accepting blocks,
    as does Bitcoin. There are many other concensus methods in the blockchain world.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
    Transactions are free to process in Teddy Token. Real blockchains can charge a transaction fee to
    the sender.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
    The target value in Teddy Token is small to make mining fast for your convenience.
    The larger the target value - the number of zeros required at the start of the final block header hash -
    the more computation it takes to find the nonce. The Bitcoin target is increased periodically as computers
    get faster in order to keep the mining time at approximately 10 minutes.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
    The total number of Teddy tokens is limited only by your persistence, since the block mining reward
    is constant. The total number of bitcoins is limited to 21 million by the eventual reduction to zero
    of the block reward.
  </p>
  </li>
  </ol>
