  <h3>Cryptographic hash</h3>
  </p>
  <p>
    This is an interactive simulation of the MD2 hash algorithm. This
    hash was introduced by Ronald Rivest in 1989. It is no longer secure
    and has been replaced by others such as SHA-256. But MD2 is simple
    to understand as a basis for learning about hash algorithms.
  <p>
    Hashing consists of processing messages of arbitrary length to a unique hash
    value of fixed length such that any change in the message results in a
    change in the hash value. This result is valuable. You can verify that a
    message hasn’t been tampered with by running the message through the hash
    algorithm and ensuring that the hash value hasn’t changed from that supplied
    with the message. Even a tiny change in the message will result in a large
    and obvious change in the hash. In that case, you know that the message has
    been tampered with.
  <p>
    After you enter or edit a message, click the Hash button and see the
    result. Then copy the message and hash. Then make a trivial change in
    the message, hash, and see how the hash result has changed.

    The Reactor Lab provides interactive chemical reactor
    simulations for active learning. The web site is
    <a href="https://reactorlab.net/">ReactorLab.net</a>.
    Web Labs and desktop versions of ReactorLab and SimzLab,
    which includes PureWaterLab, are available.
    The lab is provided free of charge and code is open source and available
    at <a href="https://github.com/RichardHerz">our GitHub site</a>.
    The code is structured to allow fast construction of new simulations of reactors and other systems.
    The author of Reactor Lab is Richard K. Herz, emeritus professor of chemical engineering
    at the University of California, San Diego, <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">UCSD</a>,
    in the <a href="http://nanoengineering.ucsd.edu/">Department of NanoEngineering</a>.
    Please let us know if you use the Lab or the code. Thanks!
