    <b><i>Batch Reactor</i></b> - isothermal, n-th order reaction
  </p>

  <p>
    <b><i>Reaction.</i></b> The reaction is A &rarr; products. The reaction is n-th-order in reactant. For simplicity, the reaction equilibrium composition is
    specified to be almost all product under all conditions, i.e., an essentially irreversible reaction.
    The concentration of reactant A is represented as Ca.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b><i>Reactor content color.</i></b> The color of the reactant is blue and the color of the product is red.
    After the first run, only the color of the final contents of the reactor is shown.
