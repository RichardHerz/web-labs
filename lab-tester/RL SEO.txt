  simulations for students of chemistry, chemical engineering, and especially chemical reaction
  engineering or CRE. The simulations can be used by individuals, or by students in high school,
  college and university-level courses. Web Labs and desktop versions of ReactorLab and SimzLab,
  including PureWaterLab, are available. All software is provided free of charge and all code is
  open source and available at our GitHub site, github.com/RichardHerz. The code is structured
  to allow fast construction of new simulations of chemical reactors and other systems."/>
