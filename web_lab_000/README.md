Lab 000 – Artificial Zoo using SVG graphics

Draw fractal zoo animals and plants from "DNA genes" using an L-system: Brackens, gaskets, etc.

This "artificial zoo" program is an L-system

Which, it appears to me, is a particular implementation of an Iterated Function System https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system

I was inspired to code this from one of Richard Dawkins’ books, The Blind Watchmaker or The Selfish Gene
