GETTER & SETTERS TO ADD 

WARNING: check lab files other than simParams for get/set from controller and interfacer 
         also check plotter and plotInfo 

BUT, AS LONG AS NAMES DON'T CHANGE, units should be able to get & set values as before
until I get around to changing all... 

-- IN CONTROLLER --- 

set setSSflag(ssflag) {this.ssFlag = ssflag;} // var names case sensitive 

get getSimTime() {return this.simTime;} 

--- IN INTERFACER --- 

none to add - although have to use getters & setters in controller and simParams 

--- IN SIMPARAMS --- 

NOTE ALL PROCESS UNITS GET simStepRepeats & simTimeStep 

BUT, AS LONG AS NAMES DON'T CHANGE, units should be able to get & set values as before
until I get around to changing all... 

BUT, if I add calls in common JS files, then will get error if not present in individual
labs, though easy to add to all simParam files, at least... 

NOTE process_sim_params.js IS LAB SPECFIC AND HAS TO BE CHANGED IN ALL LABS! 

Seems like need getter for all values in simParams - they are to be used in the sim! 

CAN DO ONE-LINERS UNTIL WANT TO ADD MORE FUNCTIONALITY 

// GETTERS & SETTERS SO NO DIRECT ACCESS TO THESE VARIABLES:
//
get getLabType() {return this.labType;},
get getTitle() {return this.title;},
get getSimStepRepeats() {return this.simStepRepeats;},
get getSimTimeStep() {return this.simTimeStep;},
get getSimTimeUnits() {return this.simTimeUnits;},
get getDisplayTimingMs() {return this.displayTimingMs;},
get getOldDataFlag() {return this.oldDataFlag;},
//
set setLabType(labtype) {this.labType = labtype;}, // var names case sensitive
set setSimTimeStep(timestep) {this.simTimeStep = timestep},
