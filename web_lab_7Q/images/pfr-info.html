    <b><i>Plug Flow Reactor simulation</i></b> - Web Labs at www.ReactorLab.net - by Richard K. Herz
  </p>

  <p>
    This is a dynamic (transient, unsteady-state) simulation of a plug flow reactor (PFR)
    packed with porous solid catalyst pellets. This type of reactor is called a packed bed
    reactor.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is an annular heat exchange jacket surrounding the reactor. For simplicity, we
    specify that the temperature of the heat exchange fluid in the jacket is constant throughout
    the jacket. Energy may be transferred between the reactor and the heat exchange jacket for
    non-zero values of the heat exchange coefficient-area parameter UA. For "adiabatic" operation,
    set UA to zero.
  </p>

  <p>
    The reaction is A &rarr; products. The reaction is first-order in reactant. For simplicity, the reaction equilibrium composition is
    specified to be almost all product under all conditions, i.e., an essentially irreversible reaction.
    The concentration of reactant A is represented as Ca. Constant fluid density is assumed.
    Currently in this simulation, the only heat capacities which affect the dynamic response are that of the fluid and catalyst.
    The heat capacity of the reactor body may be added later.
